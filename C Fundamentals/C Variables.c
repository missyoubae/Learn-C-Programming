#C Variables
In the previous code you learnt about C comments. Now, let's learn about variables

#Variables
In programming, a variable is a container (storage area) to hold data.

To indicate the storage area, each variable should be given a unique name (identifier). Variable names are just the symbolic representation of a memory location. For example:

int age = 25;
Here, age is a variable of int type and we have assigned an integer value 25 to it.

The value of a variable can be changed, hence the name variable.

char ch = 'a';
// some code
ch = 'l';
